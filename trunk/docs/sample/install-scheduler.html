  This is the page that users will see if they choose to install the Scheduler
  and they have Java 5.0 installed.

  This page opens Java Web Start with the Scheduler JNLP file, which causes the
  Scheduler to be installed and run.

  You should change all references to "My School Scheduler" to the name of your
  school's scheduler.

  You should feel free to customize this page in any way you want to make it fit
  into your site like any other page would.

    <h1> Installing My School Scheduler... </h1>

    <p>
      Installation will begin shortly. If it does not, you can
      <a href="run/scheduler.jnlp">install My School Scheduler manually</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      My School Scheduler may ask you several questions with scary Warning
      icons. You should read each one and click "Yes" to install My School
      Scheduler properly.
